# Experimental website for tracking emotion of characters in videos in real-time
This is an example experimental website to collect emotion data (e.g. valence, arousal, emotion categories) while subjects are viewing videos and judging the emotion of a chosen character as the video is playing.

You can try out an example experiment here: https://secret-antonym-288317.web.app/

The main files that define the website are "index.html" and "index.js" in the public folder.
